I have issue in connecting the Mongoose with ATLAS MongoDB DATABASE it showing error like
ERROR:
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted. Make sure your current IP address is on your Atlas cluster's IP whitelist: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-whitelist/

I Connected with Mentor - Venkata Gopichand regarding the issue, mentor said like
-> The issue may be due to our area.

But its connecting with MongoDB Compass and i testes API Endpoints everything is working Fine

The only Problem is connecting with the ATLAS MongoDB DATABASE

So in the render it may not show the Data
